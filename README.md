# Rust Quiz

## About

This codebase a barebones application to run a quiz game in
a style inspired by the trademarked game *Jeopardy!*.

This is an independently-developed game environment created
without the knowledge or permission of *Jeopardy!*
Productions. The supplied quiz game is "Mario" trivia based
on the Nintendo character, but is again an
independently-developed quiz created without the knowledge
or permission of Nintendo, Inc.

The code is structured such that one can easily replace the
quiz text in the application

This game framework is written in Rust, using the Bevy engine.

## Usage

This is a rather basic Rust setup, so usage should be straightforward.

This is my first Rust application, so if anything seems off
or strange then it probably just is: issue reports and
patches are welcome.

This was written with version 1.54.0 installed, and should
be able to be run via `cargo run`.
